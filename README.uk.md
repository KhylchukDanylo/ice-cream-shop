## Landing site project

### "Sweet start" team

Potential users: teenage audience and their parents. The layout is implemented
in three breakpoints, namely: mobile, tablet, desktop versions.

## Header

Our header is a universal solution for site navigation, including to go to the
top because by clicking on the logo you go to the hero section. Despite the lack
of a full-fledged backend for our store managed to implement an interface for
choosing the amount of ice cream and an interface for feedback on cooperation.

## Hero

Our team decided to add some built-in solutions, the first of which is the
ability to watch thematic videos directly on our website.

## Products

In the section, animations of turning the cards by 180deg via JS have been added

## About us

A modal window with an adaptive timeline has been added to the section

## Advantages

The layout corresponds to the layout

## Gallery

The AOS Animation library was used to create the gallery

## Customer

In this section, a slider with a large functionality was implemented, which
allows you to flip through reviews in any convenient way (shooters/page
up/down/mouse). And yes, here are real members of our team and their feedback:
not about ice cream, but about the impressions of participating in the project.

## Contacts

Several modal windows have been implemented in this section, the first for
search us on the map, we used a built-in solution with a very convenient
interface, and the second for feedback on cooperation. We can even expand the
map to see all three points on one map Of course, we could not do without Easter
and added another extraordinary place in which you can visit to taste ice cream
in the company of good peopleðŸ˜‰

## Footer

The layout corresponds to the layout, the links go to the relevant sites.

We chose the adaptive layout option, because our landing page for small and
medium-sized businesses is much cheaper than a responsive analogue, also, the
majority of young people (who are potentially the main audience of the site)
prefer mobile devices, so in in our case, it was more important to focus on the
interactivity of the site than on its responsiveness.
